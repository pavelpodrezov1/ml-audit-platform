requests     2.31.0  CVE-2024-35195      2.32.0       When making requests through a Requests `Session`, if the first request is made with `verify=False` to disable cert verification, all subsequent requests to the same origin will continue to ignore cert verification regardless of changes to the value of `verify`. This behavior will continue for the lifecycle of the connection in the connection pool.  ### Remediation Any of these options can be used to remediate the current issue, we highly recommend upgrading as the preferred mitigation.  * Upgrade to `requests>=2.32.0`. * For `requests<2.32.0`, avoid setting `verify=False` for the first request to a host while using a Requests Session. * For `requests<2.32.0`, call `close()` on `Session` objects to clear existing connections if `verify=False` is used.  ### Related Links * https://github.com/psf/requests/pull/6655
requests     2.31.0  CVE-2024-47081      2.32.4       ### Impact  Due to a URL parsing issue, Requests releases prior to 2.32.4 may leak .netrc credentials to third parties for specific maliciously-crafted URLs.  ### Workarounds For older versions of Requests, use of the .netrc file can be disabled with `trust_env=False` on your Requests Session ([docs](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/#requests.Session.trust_env)).  ### References https://github.com/psf/requests/pull/6965 https://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2025/Jun/2
cryptography 3.4.8   PYSEC-2023-254      41.0.6       cryptography is a package designed to expose cryptographic primitives and recipes to Python developers. Calling `load_pem_pkcs7_certificates` or `load_der_pkcs7_certificates` could lead to a NULL-pointer dereference and segfault. Exploitation of this vulnerability poses a serious risk of Denial of Service (DoS) for any application attempting to deserialize a PKCS7 blob/certificate. The consequences extend to potential disruptions in system availability and stability. This vulnerability has been patched in version 41.0.6.
cryptography 3.4.8   CVE-2023-23931      39.0.1       Previously, `Cipher.update_into` would accept Python objects which implement the buffer protocol, but provide only immutable buffers:  ```pycon >>> outbuf = b"\x00" * 32 >>> c = ciphers.Cipher(AES(b"\x00" * 32), modes.ECB()).encryptor() >>> c.update_into(b"\x00" * 16, outbuf) 16 >>> outbuf b'\xdc\x95\xc0x\xa2@\x89\x89\xadH\xa2\x14\x92\x84 \x87\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00' ```  This would allow immutable objects (such as `bytes`) to be mutated, thus violating fundamental rules of Python. This is a soundness bug -- it allows programmers to misuse an API, it cannot be exploited by attacker controlled data alone.  This now correctly raises an exception.  This issue has been present since `update_into` was originally introduced in cryptography 1.8.
cryptography 3.4.8   CVE-2023-0286       39.0.1       pyca/cryptography's wheels include a statically linked copy of OpenSSL. The versions of OpenSSL included in cryptography 0.8.1-39.0.0  are vulnerable to a security issue. More details about the vulnerabilities themselves can be found in https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20221213.txt and https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20230207.txt.  If you are building cryptography source ("sdist") then you are responsible for upgrading your copy of OpenSSL. Only users installing from wheels built by the cryptography project (i.e., those distributed on PyPI) need to update their cryptography versions.

cryptography 3.4.8   CVE-2023-50782      42.0.0       A flaw was found in the python-cryptography package. This issue may allow a remote attacker to decrypt captured messages in TLS servers that use RSA key exchanges, which may lead to exposure of confidential or sensitive data.

cryptography 3.4.8   CVE-2024-0727       42.0.2       Issue summary: Processing a maliciously formatted PKCS12 file may lead OpenSSL to crash leading to a potential Denial of Service attack  Impact summary: Applications loading files in the PKCS12 format from untrusted sources might terminate abruptly.  A file in PKCS12 format can contain certificates and keys and may come from an untrusted source. The PKCS12 specification allows certain fields to be NULL, but OpenSSL does not correctly check for this case. This can lead to a NULL pointer dereference that results in OpenSSL crashing. If an application processes PKCS12 files from an untrusted source using the OpenSSL APIs then that application will be vulnerable to this issue.  OpenSSL APIs that are vulnerable to this are: PKCS12_parse(), PKCS12_unpack_p7data(), PKCS12_unpack_p7encdata(), PKCS12_unpack_authsafes() and PKCS12_newpass().  We have also fixed a similar issue in SMIME_write_PKCS7(). However since this function is related to writing data we do not consider it security significant.  The FIPS modules in 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.
